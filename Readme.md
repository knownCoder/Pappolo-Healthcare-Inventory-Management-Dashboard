## Day - 1

```
I designed a Power BI dashboard for hospital workflow management (Papollo Hospitals). The dashboard captures and visualizes key patient-related information, including:

Admit Date, Discharge Date, and Follow-up Date displayed in cards for quick reference.

Billing Amount summarized with a dynamic display.

An interactive date range slicer to filter patient records.

A Patient ID filter for individual-level analysis.

This setup helps in tracking patient journeys, monitoring discharge and follow-up timelines, and analyzing billing patterns efficiently.

```
