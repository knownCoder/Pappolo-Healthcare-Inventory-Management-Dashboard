## Day - 1

```
I designed a Power BI dashboard for hospital workflow management (Papollo Hospitals). The dashboard captures and visualizes key patient-related information, including:

Admit Date, Discharge Date, and Follow-up Date displayed in cards for quick reference.

Billing Amount summarized with a dynamic display.

An interactive date range slicer to filter patient records.

A Patient ID filter for individual-level analysis.

This setup helps in tracking patient journeys, monitoring discharge and follow-up timelines, and analyzing billing patterns efficiently.

Project Description: Hospital Workflow & Leads Dashboard (Power BI)

This dashboard was developed to provide a comprehensive view of hospital operations and patient data using interactive Power BI visuals. The key components include:

Patient Information (by Patient_ID):
Allows filtering and analysis of individual patient records, including admit date, discharge date, and follow-up date.

Billing Information:
Displays total billing amount with dynamic calculations to monitor hospital revenue trends.

Bed Occupancy Breakdown:
Visualized the distribution of patients across Private, General, and ICU wards for capacity management.

Doctor Feedback Analysis:
Collected and represented overall feedback volume for doctors using a donut chart to evaluate performance.

Diagnosis-wise Statistics:
Showed patient count across different diagnoses (Viral Infection, Flu, Malaria, Typhoid, Pneumonia, Fracture) to track common health issues.

Billing vs Insurance Comparison:
Compared billing amounts against health insurance coverage across diagnoses to analyze financial impact and patient affordability.
